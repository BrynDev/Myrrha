Myrrha is a 3D platformer with high scores and a local leaderboard. It was created as a group project created during my education at Howest DAE.\
This was my first time working with C++ in Unreal Engine. It was a tough challenge but nevertheless one I was able to overcome in order to successfully develop this game.\
