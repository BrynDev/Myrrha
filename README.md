# Myrrha
Arcadey 3D platformer with high scores and a local leaderboard. A group project created during my education at Howest DAE.
This was my first time working with C++ in Unreal Engine. It was a tough challenge but nevertheless one I was able to overcome in order to successfully develop this game.
